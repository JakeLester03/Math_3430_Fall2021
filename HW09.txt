Floating point numbers are a way in which numbers can be represented
in computers. Floating points work by converting a number into it's mantissa
and exponent part, which looks similar to scientific notation. This also
allows for computers to represent a large variety of integers and fractions. Because 
the decimal is essentially "floating," floating point numbers can be reprensented in a 
wide range of ways, whereas "fixed" point numbers can only be represented in a fixed number of 
ways. This could be an advantage when it comes to storing numbers, since the ways the numbers would be represented are fixed.
An advantage to floating point is accurcacy, as the gaps between the numbers increases
with magnitude, whereas with fixed point the gap is constant. Because floating point is able to
store and represent very small and very large numbers, a downfall to this would cost the computer
storage space.
