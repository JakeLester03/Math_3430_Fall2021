After having taken this course, there are a few projects I would like to work on in the future:

-I would like to continuing working on python, learning how to code better and more efficiently,
so that given the oppourtnity I would be able to code a wide variety of projects.

- Second, I would like to work on other programming languages. I think that having a variety of other programming
languages under my belt would be useful for various projects and future jobs.

- A third option would be to work on a translator application for ancient languages. My second degree focus on 
ancient languages, however it is nearly impossible to translate these with any sort of modern application. Most 
know that Google Translate is fine for translating basic phrases from one modern language into another, but realize 
that something is lost as sentences and texts get longer and more complex. However, there are not any translator 
applications for ancient languages such as Greek or Latin. Well, there is a Google Translate for Latin, but it is 
actually very bad, almost to the point of it being nonexistant. But its a starts, and I suppose all applications start
somewhere. I would like to see improvements of this in the future, and possibly an iteration of this for other ancient dead
langauges. The closest application I can think of for Ancient Greek is a website called Logeion, which is essentailly just an
online dictionary, which was created out of the University of Chicago. Something that is interesting is that I belive it was written
in python, however it couldve been another langauge. But nevertheless, I think it is in interesting project that needed the 
consultation of both Classical scholars and computer scientists. To embark on a project like this, or perhaps even expanding it
into a translation would both be an unprecedented and filling task.
